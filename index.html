<h1><li>ABOUT ME</h1></li>
<hr>
<pr>I am a highly self-motivated, focused and innovative civil engineer. I have a passion for learning and developing new
    and existing expertise. I have gained both analytical and practical skills necessary to solve various problems in my
    career. Moreover, I have obtained a high level of proficiency in BIM modeling, developing and managing 3D projects for
    structural, architectural and MEP systems. I am looking forward to further my experiences and be part of a wellorganized
    team with creative ideas. I am keen to secure a challenging role at an engineering firm that offers early
    responsibilities and a progressive career path.</pr>
